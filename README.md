# plotly_deploy

In this project, I have created interactive charts with data on belly buttons and the different species of bacteria. When a sample ID is selected, the top 10 bacterial species of the sample's belly button are displayed.

I used plotly and d3 to grab json data and load it dynamically on a website. 

I set it up to automatically populate with the first user, then dynamically change when you use the dropdown menu, so that the user demographic information, top 10 bacteria (bar chart), and bubble chart of all the user's bacteria in size with hover text shows up.
